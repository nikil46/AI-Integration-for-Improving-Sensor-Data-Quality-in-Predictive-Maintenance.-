 AI Integration for Improving Sensor Data Quality in Predictive Maintenance

 Overview
This project focuses on integrating AI techniques to improve sensor data quality for predictive maintenance. The approach includes advanced data preprocessing, anomaly detection, model training, AutoML, and dashboard development to monitor real-time sensor data. The objective is to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce false alarms.

 Features
- **Advanced Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, detects outliers, and balances class distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and AutoML-based optimization.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Displays sensor anomalies and predictive maintenance insights.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploys AI models using IBM Cloud and Watson Studio.

 1. Installation
 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn flask AutoML chart.js
  ```
- IBM Cloud Account (for cloud deployment)

---
 2. Data Preprocessing
 Handling Missing Values
Using Iterative Imputer to estimate missing values:
```python
from sklearn.impute import IterativeImputer
import pandas as pd

data_imputer = IterativeImputer(random_state=42)
data_cleaned = pd.DataFrame(data_imputer.fit_transform(data), columns=data.columns)
```
 Outlier Detection
Applying Local Outlier Factor (LOF):
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor
lof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=20, contamination=0.05)
outliers = lof.fit_predict(data_cleaned.drop(columns=['target']))
data_cleaned = data_cleaned[outliers == 1]
```
 Addressing Imbalanced Classes
Using ADASYN to balance the dataset:
```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import ADASYN
adasyn = ADASYN(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = adasyn.fit_resample(data_cleaned.drop(columns=['target']), data_cleaned['target'])
```

 5. Cloud Deployment
The AI model was deployed using IBM Cloud and Watson Studio.
 Deployment Steps:
1. Create an IBM Cloud account and set up a Watson Machine Learning service.
2. Upload the trained model to IBM Cloud.
3. Obtain API credentials for real-time inference.

 API Integration with IoT Systems
A REST API was developed to interface with IoT sensor networks:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import random

app = Flask(__name__)

def generate_sensor_data():
    sensors = []
    for i in range(1, 11):
        reading = round(random.uniform(10, 100), 2)
        status = "Normal" if reading > 60 else "Noisy" if reading > 30 else "Anomalous"
        sensors.append({"id": f"Sensor-{i}", "reading": reading, "status": status})
    return sensors

@app.route('/sensor-data', methods=['GET'])
def get_sensor_data():
    return jsonify(generate_sensor_data())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```
